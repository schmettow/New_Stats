          author = {Robbin {Koopman}},
        abstract = {It was previously expected that increasing a robot?s human likeness would increase its likability. Mori (1970) argued that at some point, as a robot resembles a human too much and its non-human features become more salient, the emotional response to these becomes negative instead. This negative dip is referred to as the ?Uncanny Valley?.
Which cognitive mechanisms underlie the UV is still uncertain. There is an on-going debate on whether the cause lies in individual differences or innate human traits. To examine the role of individual differences, the first question to ask should be whether the UV is a universal experience. Additionally, it could be examined whether the trough of the UV is at the same position for everyone. 
	The current study aims at answering these questions by replicating Mathur and Reichling?s (2016) experiment, adding multi-level modelling. Data analysis showed that every participant (n=26) experienced the UV, but variation exists in individual responses. This suggests that innate traits are at the core of the UV experience, but that individual differences may modulate sensitivity to the phenomenon. From previous literature, it is unclear which differences significantly impact this sensitivity. Future research should continue to focus on factors modulating this sensitivity.},

@article{Molich2010d,
abstract = {This paper reports on the approach and results of CUE-8, the eighth in a series of Comparative Usability Evaluation studies. Fifteen experienced professional usability teams simultaneously and independently measured a baseline for the usability of the car rental website Budget.com. The CUE-8 study documented a wide difference in measurement approaches. Teams that used similar approaches often reached similar results. This paper discusses a number of common pitfalls in usability measurements. This paper also points out a number of fundamental problems in unmoderated measurement studies, which were used by 6 of the 15 participating teams. CUE-8 confirmed a number of rules for good measurement practice. Perhaps the most interesting result from CUE-8 is that these rules were not always observed by the participating professional teams. Adhere strictly to precisely defined measurement procedures for quantitative tests. Report time-on-task, success/failure rate and satisfaction for quantitative tests. Exclude failed times from average task completion times. Understand the inherent variability from samples. Use strict participant screening criteria. Provide confidence intervals around your results if this is possible. Keep in mind that time-on-task is not normally distributed and therefore confidence intervals as commonly computed on raw scores may be misleading. Combine qualitative and quantitative findings in your report. Present what happened (quantitative data) and support it with why it happened (qualitative data). Qualitative data provide considerable insight regarding the serious obstacles that users faced and it is counterproductive not to report this insight. Justify the composition and size of your participant samples. This is the only way you have to allow your client to judge how much confidence they should place in your results. When using unmoderated methodologies for quantitative tests ensure that you can distinguish between extreme and incorrect results. Although unmoderated testing can exhibit a remarkable productivity in terms of user tasks measured with a limited effort, quantity of data is no substitute for clean data.},

@article{Ho2017a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Using a hypothetical graph, Masahiro Mori proposed in 1970 the relation between the human likeness of robots and other anthropomorphic characters and an observer's affective or emotional appraisal of them. The relation is positive apart from a U-shaped region known as the uncanny valley. To measure the relation, we previously developed and validated indices for the perceptual-cognitive dimension humanness and three affective dimensions: interpersonal warmth, attractiveness, and eeriness. Nevertheless, the design of these indices was not informed by how the untrained observer perceives anthropomorphic characters categorically. As a result, scatter plots of humanness vs. eeriness show the stimuli cluster tightly into categories widely separated from each other. The present study applies a card sorting task, laddering interview, and adjective evaluation (N= 30) to revise the humanness, attractiveness, and eeriness indices and validate them via a representative survey (N= 1311). The revised eeriness index maintains its orthogonality to humanness (r=. 04 , p=. 285), but the stimuli show much greater spread, reflecting the breadth of their range in human likeness and eeriness. The revised indices enable empirical relations among characters to be plotted similarly to Mori's graph of the uncanny valley. Accurate measurement with these indices can be used to enhance the design of androids and 3D computer animated characters.},

The non-ignorable missing mechanism is defined via a logistic regression model. Based on conjugate prior distributions, full conditional distributions for the implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in simulating observations from the joint posterior distribution are derived. These observations are used in computing the Bayesian estimates, as well as in implementing a path sampling procedure to evaluate the Bayes factor for model comparison. The proposed methods are illustrated using real data from a study on the non-adherence of hypertension patients.},

Every chapter contains many well chosen examples and ends with several problems related to the earlier developed theory (some with hints). a At the very end of the book there is an appendix collecting necessary facts from set theory, calculus and metric spaces. The authors suggest a few possibilities on how to use their book." (Kazimierz Musial, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1125 (2), 2008) "The title of the book consists of the names of its two basic parts. The booka (TM)s third part is comprised of some special topics from probability theory. a The authors suggest using the book intwo-semester graduate programs in statistics or a one-semester seminar on special topics. The material of the book is standard a is clear, comprehensive and a {\~{}}without being intimidatinga (TM)." (Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes. From the reviews: "...There are interesting and non-standard topics that are not usually included in a first course in measture-theoretic probability including Markov Chains and MCMC, the bootstrap, limit theorems for martingales and mixing sequences, Brownian motion and Markov processes. The material is well-suported with many end-of-chapter problems." D.L. McLeish for Short Book Reviews of the ISI, December 2006},

abstract = {A growing number of researchers use descriptive distributions such as the ex-Gaussian and the shifted Wald to summarize response time data for speeded two-choice tasks. Some of these researchers also assume that the parameters of these distributions uniquely correspond to specific cognitive processes. We studied the validity of this cognitive interpretation by relating the parameters of the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald distributions to those of the Ratcliff diffusion model, a successful model whose parameters have well-established cognitive interpretations. In a simulation study, we fitted the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald distributions to data generated from the diffusion model by systematically varying its parameters across a wide range of plausible values. In an empirical study, the two descriptive distributions were fitted to published data that featured manipulations of task difficulty, response caution, and a priori bias. The results clearly demonstrate that the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald parameters do not correspond uniquely to parameters of the diffusion model. We conclude that researchers should resist the temptation to interpret changes in the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald parameters in terms of cognitive processes.

abstract = {The "law of practice"-a simple nonlinear function describing the relationship between mean response time (RT) and practice-has provided a practically and theoretically useful way of quantifying the speed-up that characterizes skill acquisition. Early work favored a power law, but this was shown to be an artifact of biases caused by averaging over participants who are individually better described by an exponential law. However, both power and exponential functions make the strong assumption that the speedup always proceeds at a steadily decreasing rate, even though there are sometimes clear exceptions. We propose a new law that can both accommodate an initial delay resulting in a slower-faster-slower rate of learning, with either power or exponential forms as limiting cases, and which can account for not only mean RT but also the effect of practice on the entire distribution of RT. We evaluate this proposal with data from a broad array of tasks using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, which pools data across participants while minimizing averaging artifacts, and using inference procedures that take into account differences in flexibility among laws. In a clear majority of paradigms our results supported a delayed exponential law. (PsycINFO Database Record},

abstract = {In the field of cognitive psychology, the p-value hypothesis test has established a stranglehold on statistical reporting. This is unfortunate, as the p-value provides at best a rough estimate of the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an experimental effect. An alternative and arguably more appropriate measure of evidence is conveyed by a Bayesian hypothesis test, which prefers the model with the highest average likelihood. One of the main problems with this Bayesian hypothesis test, however, is that it often requires relatively sophisticated numerical methods for its computation. Here we draw attention to the Savage-Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method's validity, generality, and flexibility. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This paper proposes a two-level structural equation model for analyzing multivariate longitudinal responses that are mixed continuous and ordered categorical variables. The first-level model is defined for measures taken at each time point nested within individuals for investigating their characteristics that are changed with time. The second level is defined for individuals to assess their characteristics that are invariant with time. The proposed model accommodates fixed covariates, nonlinear terms of the latent variables, and missing data. A maximum likelihood (ML) approach is developed for the estimation of parameters and model comparison. Results of a simulation study indicate that the performance of the ML estimation is satisfactory. The proposed methodology is applied to a longitudinal study concerning cocaine use.},

abstract = {Bayesian estimation has played a pivotal role in the understanding of individual differences. However, for many models in psychology, Bayesian estimation of model parameters can be difficult. One reason for this difficulty is that conventional sampling algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), can be inefficient and impractical when little is known about the target distribution--particularly the target distribution's covariance structure. In this article, we highlight some reasons for this inefficiency and advocate the use of a population MCMC algorithm, called differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo (DE-MCMC), as a means of efficient proposal generation. We demonstrate in a simulation study that the performance of the DE-MCMC algorithm is unaffected by the correlation of the target distribution, whereas conventional MCMC performs substantially worse as the correlation increases. We then show that the DE-MCMC algorithm can be used to efficiently fit a hierarchical version of the linear ballistic accumulator model to response time data, which has proven to be a difficult task when conventional MCMC is used.},

abstract = {User experience research has made considerable progress in understanding subjective experience with interactive technology. Nevertheless, we argue, some blind spots have remained: individual differences are frequently ignored, the prevalent measures of self-report rarely undergo verification, and overly focus is on utilitarian and hedonic dimensions of experience. A Stroop priming experiment was constructed to assess what people implicitly associate with a picture of a computing device. Three categories of target words were presented: hedonic, utilitarian and “geek” words. Longer response times were interpreted as stronger associations. Need-for-cognition and subject of undergraduate study (computer science vs. psychology) were taken as predictors for a hypothetical geek personality. The results suggest that persons with a geek predisposition tend to think of computers as objects of intellectual challenge and play, rather than tools or extensions of the self.},

abstract = {The Handbook of Computational Statistics - Concepts and Methods is divided into 4 parts. It begins with an overview of the field of Computational Statistics, how it emerged as a seperate discipline, how it developed along the development of hard- and software, including a discussion of current active research. The second part presents several topics in the supporting field of statistical computing. Emphasis is placed on the need for fast and accurate numerical algorithms, and it discusses some of the basic methodologies for transformation, data base handling and graphics treatment. The third part focuses on statistical methodology. Special attention is given to smoothing, iterative procedures, simulation and visualization of multivariate data. Finally a set of selected applications like Bioinformatics, Medical Imaging, Finance and Network Intrusion Detection highlight the usefulness of computational statistics.},

abstract = {A core aspect of science is using data to assess the degree to which data provide evidence for competing claims, hypotheses, or theories. Evidence is by definition something that should change the credibility of a claim in a reasonable person's mind. However, common statistics, such as significance testing and confidence intervals have no interface with concepts of belief, and thus it is unclear how they relate to statistical evidence. We explore the concept of statistical evidence, and how it can be quantified using the Bayes factor. We also discuss the philosophical issues inherent in the use of the Bayes factor.},

@article{VandenBerg2011,
abstract = {The purpose of this work is to describe how the visual system groups surfaces of unequal lightness under complex patterns of illumination. We propose that the Gestalt principle of Grouping by Regularity explains this process better than the more often cited principle of Grouping by Similarity. In our first experiment we demonstrate that in a perceptual organization task, pitting proximity against illumination gradients, discounting the illuminant was contingent upon the periodicity of the illuminant. Traditional theories of lightness constancy and discounting the illuminant (Rock, Nijhawan, Palmer, {\&} Tudor, 1992) cannot account for such effects. Three more experiments show that grouping is affected more by local luminance ratios than constant reflectance ratios. We conclude from these findings that Grouping by Regularity is a powerful grouping principle that operates pre-constancy.},

Multilevel models are a logical approach to analyzing such data, and deal well with the possible different time points and treatment phases for different subjects. However, they are limited in several ways that are addressed by Bayesian methods. For small samples Bayesian methods fully take into account uncertainty in random effects when estimating fixed effects; the computational methods now in use can fit complex models that represent accurately the behavior being modeled; groups of parameters can be more accurately estimated with shrinkage methods; prior information can be included; and interpretation is more straightforward. The computer programs for Bayesian analysis allow many (nonstandard) nonlinear models to be fit; an example using floor and ceiling effects is discussed here.},

abstract = {The effects of self-pacing versus system-pacing were examined in different versions of a computer-based learning environment (static pictures/animations). The role of cognitive style was also considered. While the variables investigated did not have a direct impact on either learning outcome or cognitive load, significant interaction effects were found. Concerning the difference between self- and system-pacing, results suggested that for animations, self-pacing was - as expected - effective, while for static pictures, the opposite was true. With respect to the difference between animations and static pictures, analyses showed that learners tending toward a visual cognitive style learned significantly better with animations than with static pictures. For learners tending toward a verbal style, learning outcomes were descriptively better with static pictures, although in that case the difference between animations and static pictures did not reach significance. The results indicate that self-pacing as a feature of learning environments is not universally advantageous, and highlight the importance of considering the role of individual learning differences such as cognitive style when choosing or developing computer-based learning environments. The findings are discussed considering contemporary theories of cognitive load and multimedia learning. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Visualizations have numerous benefits for problem solving, sense mak- ing, decision making, learning, analytical reasoning, and other high-level cognitive activities. Research in cognitive science has demonstrated that visualizations fun- damentally influence cognitive processing and the overall performance of such aforementioned activities. However, although researchers often suggest that visu- alizations support, enhance, and/or amplify cognition, little research has examined the cognitive utility of different visualizations in a systematic and comprehensive manner. Rather, visualization research is often focused only on low-level cognitive and perceptual issues. To design visualizations that effectively support high-level cognitive activities, a strong understanding of the cognitive effects of different visual forms is required. To examine thisissue, this chapter draws on research from a number of relevant domains, including information and data visualization, visual analytics, cognitive and perceptual psychology, and diagrammatic reasoning. This chapter identifies and clarifies some important terms and discusses the current state of research and practice. In addition, a number of common visualizations are identified, their cognitive and perceptual influences are examined, and some implications for the performance of high-level cognitive activities are discussed. Readers from various fields in which a human-centered approach to visualization is necessary, such as health informatics, data and information visualization, visual analytics, journalism, education, and human-information interaction,will likely find this chapter a useful reference for research, design, and/or evaluation purposes.},

abstract = {This paper proposes and demonstrates an extended protocol for usability validation testing of medical devices. A review of currently used methods for the usability evaluation of medical devices revealed two main shortcomings. Firstly, the lack of methods to closely trace the interaction sequences and derive performance measures. Secondly, a prevailing focus on cross-sectional validation studies, ignoring the issues of learnability and training. The U.S. Federal Drug and Food Administration's recent proposal for a validation testing protocol for medical devices is then extended to address these shortcomings: (1) a novel process measure ‘normative path deviations' is introduced that is useful for both quantitative and qualitative usability studies and (2) a longitudinal, completely within-subject study design is presented that assesses learnability, training effects and allows analysis of diversity of users. A reference regression model is introduced to analyze data from this and similar studies, drawing upon generalized linear mixed-effects models and a Bayesian estimation approach. The extended protocol is implemented and demonstrated in a study comparing a novel syringe infusion pump prototype to an existing design with a sample of 25 healthcare professionals. Strong performance differences between designs were observed with a variety of usability measures, as well as varying training-on-the-job effects. We discuss our findings with regard to validation testing guidelines, reflect on the extensions and discuss the perspectives they add to the validation process.},

Eighty children, equally divided between two age groups, 34-50 months and 58-74 months, participated in individual sessions that included play with and an interview about two artifacts: AIBO and a stuffed dog. Results showed similarities in children's reasoning about the two artifacts, but differences in their behavioral interactions. Discussion focuses on how robotic pets, as representative of an emerging technological genre in HCI, may be (a) blurring foundational ontological categories, and (b) impacting children's social and moral development.

abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

abstract = {Structural equation modelling has been used extensively in the behavioural and social sciences for studying interrelationships among manifest and latent variables. Recently, its uses have been well recognized in medical research. This paper introduces a Bayesian approach to analysing general structural equation models with dichotomous variables. In the posterior analysis, the observed dichotomous data are augmented with the hypothetical missing values, which involve the latent variables in the model and the unobserved continuous measurements underlying the dichotomous data. An algorithm based on the Gibbs sampler is developed for drawing the parameters values and the hypothetical missing values from the joint posterior distributions. Useful statistics, such as the Bayesian estimates and their standard error estimates, and the highest posterior density intervals, can be obtained from the simulated observations. A posterior predictive p-value is used to test the goodness-of-fit of the posited model. The methodology is applied to a study of hypertensive patient non-adherence to medication.},

@article{Lopilato,
abstract = {In the management literature, generalizability theory (GT) has been typically used to investigate the reliability of assessment center and job performance ratings. However, the management field has yet to take full advantage of the information GT can offer regarding the reliability of measurement. It is likely that GT has not been adopted because of the complexities involved with its notation and practical application. Moreover, current methods for obtaining accurate interval estimates around estimated variance components or their reliability coefficients are not easily implementable. Alternatively, Bayesian methods provide a different method for estimating GT variance components. Bayesian methods enable management researchers to estimate the posterior distributions of each GT variance component as well as the GT reliability coefficients. From these posterior distribu-tions, researchers can easily obtain the interval estimates for each variance component and the corresponding reliability estimates. Conducting two studies, the authors examine what priors should be used when conducting a Bayesian GT analysis and what estimates should be used to summarize a variance component's posterior distribution. Additionally, the authors find that under certain conditions, Bayesian methods perform better than frequentist methods.},

abstract = {A generalised linear model (GLM) or a generalised additive model (GAM) consists of three steps: (i) the distribution of the response variable, (ii) the specification of the systematic component in terms of explanatory variables, and (iii) the link between the mean of the response variable and the systematic part. In Chapter 8, we discussed several different distributions for the response variable: Normal, Poisson, negative binomial, geometric, gamma, Bernoulli, and binomial distributions. One of these distributions can be used for the first step mentioned above. In fact, later in Chapter 11, we see how you can also use a mixture of two distributions for the response variable; but in this chapter, we only work with one distribution at a time.},

abstract = {This paper is an introduction to model selection intended for nonspecialists who have knowledge of the statistical concepts covered in a typical first (occasionally second) statistics course. The intention is to explain the ideas that generate frequentist methodology for model selection, for example the Akaike information criterion, bootstrap criteria, and cross-validation criteria. Bayesian methods, including the Bayesian information criterion, are also mentioned in the context of the framework outlined in the paper. The ideas are illustrated using an example in which observations are available for the entire population of interest. This enables us to examine and to measure effects that are usually invisible, because in practical applications only a sample from the population is observed. The problem of selection bias, a hazard of which one needs to be aware in the context of model selection, is also discussed. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {This article describes a linear modeling approach for the analysis of single-case designs (SCDs). Effect size measures in SCDs have been defined and studied for the situation where there is a level change without a time trend. However, when there are level and trend changes, effect size measures are either defined in terms of changes in R(2) or defined separately for changes in slopes and intercept coefficients. We propose an alternate effect size measure that takes into account changes in slopes and intercepts in the presence of serial dependence and provides an integrated procedure for the analysis of SCDs through estimation and inference based directly on the effect size measure. A Bayesian procedure is described to analyze the data and draw inferences in SCDs. A multilevel model that is appropriate when several subjects are available is integrated into the Bayesian procedure to provide a standardized effect size measure comparable to effect size measures in a between-subjects design. The applicability of the Bayesian approach for the analysis of SCDs is demonstrated through an example.},

abstract = {This article discusses how to make statistical graphics a more prominent element of the undergraduate statistics curricula. The focus is on several different types of assignments that exemplify how to incorporate graphics into a course in a pedagogically meaningful way. These assignments include having students deconstruct and reconstruct plots, copy masterful graphs, create one-minute visual revelations, convert tables into `pictures', and develop interactive visualizations with, e.g., the virtual earth as a plotting canvas. In addition to describing the goals and details of each assignment, we also discuss the broader topic of graphics and key concepts that we think warrant inclusion in the statistics curricula. We advocate that more attention needs to be paid to this fundamental field of statistics at all levels, from introductory undergraduate through graduate level courses. With the rapid rise of tools to visualize data, e.g., Google trends, GapMinder, ManyEyes, and Tableau, and the increased use of graphics in the media, understanding the principles of good statistical graphics, and having the ability to create informative visualizations is an ever more important aspect of statistics education.},

abstract = {Meta-analysis is a statistical method of synthesizing quantitative results across studies examining a common research question. This chapter discusses the logic and methods of meta-analysis with specific application to the field of criminology and criminal justice. A key feature of meta-analysis is the effect size, which encodes the study findings on a common index, such as the standardized mean difference, correlation coefficient, or odds-ratio. Analysis of these effect sizes considers not only the central tendency of effects across studies but also the relationship of study features to variability in effects. Both fixed- and random-effects models are discussed, as are the important issue of publication selection bias. Meta-analysis applies social science methodology and statistical methods to the task of taking stock of the evidence in an area, providing a robust foundation for future research and theorizing.},

abstract = {The effects of self-pacing versus system-pacing were examined in different versions of a computer-based learning environment (static pictures/animations). The role of cognitive style was also considered. While the variables investigated did not have a direct impact on either learning outcome or cognitive load, significant interaction effects were found. Concerning the difference between self- and system-pacing, results suggested that for animations, self-pacing was - as expected - effective, while for static pictures, the opposite was true. With respect to the difference between animations and static pictures, analyses showed that learners tending toward a visual cognitive style learned significantly better with animations than with static pictures. For learners tending toward a verbal style, learning outcomes were descriptively better with static pictures, although in that case the difference between animations and static pictures did not reach significance. The results indicate that self-pacing as a feature of learning environments is not universally advantageous, and highlight the importance of considering the role of individual learning differences such as cognitive style when choosing or developing computer-based learning environments. The findings are discussed considering contemporary theories of cognitive load and multimedia learning. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The deviance information criterion (DIC) is widely used for Bayesian model comparison, despite the lack of a clear theoretical foundation. DIC is shown to be an approximation to a penalized loss function based on the deviance, with a penalty derived from a cross-validation argument. This approximation is valid only when the effective number of parameters in the model is much smaller than the number of independent observations. In disease mapping, a typical application of DIC, this assumption does not hold and DIC under-penalizes more complex models. Another deviance-based loss function, derived from the same decision-theoretic framework, is applied to mixture models, which have previously been considered an unsuitable application for DIC.},

abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to develop a Bayesian approach for the multisample factor analysis model with continuous and polytomous variables. Joint Bayesian estimates of the thresholds, the factor scores and the structural parameters subjected to some simple constraints across groups are obtained simultaneously. The Gibbs sampler is used to produce the joint Bayesian estimates. It is shown that the conditional distributions involved in the implementation are the familiar uniform, gamma, normal, univariate truncated normal and Wishart distributions. The Bayes factor is introduced to test hypotheses involving constraints among the structural parameters of the factor analysis models across groups. Two procedures for computing the test statistics are developed, one based on the Schwarz criterion (or Bayesian information criterion), while the other computes the posterior densities and likelihood ratios by means of draws from the appropriate conditional distributions via the Gibbs sampler. The empirical performance of the proposed Bayesian procedure and its sensitivity to prior distributions are illustrated by some simulation results and two real-life examples.},

Among frequentists in psychology a shift of emphasis from hypothesis testing to estimation has been dubbed " the New Statistics " (Cumming, 2014). A second conceptual distinction is between frequentist methods and Bayesian methods. Our main goal in this article is to explain how Bayesian methods achieve the goals of the New Statistics better than frequentist methods. The article reviews frequentist and Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing and to estimation with confidence or credible intervals. The article also describes Bayesian approaches to meta-analysis, random control trials, and planning (e.g., power analysis).},

abstract = {The change detection paradigm has become an important tool for researchers studying working memory. Change detection is especially useful for studying visual working memory, because recall paradigms are difficult to employ in the visual modality. Pashler (Perception {\&} Psychophysics, 44, 369-378, 1988) and Cowan (Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 24, 87-114, 2001) suggested formulas for estimating working memory capacity from change detection data. Although these formulas have become widely used, Morey (Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 55, 8-24, 2011) showed that the formulas suffer from a number of issues, including inefficient use of information, bias, volatility, uninterpretable parameter estimates, and violation of ANOVA assumptions. Morey presented a hierarchical Bayesian extension of Pashler's and Cowan's basic models that mitigates these issues. Here, we present WoMMBAT (Working Memory Modeling using Bayesian Analysis Techniques) software for fitting Morey's model to data. WoMMBAT has a graphical user interface, is freely available, and is cross-platform, running on Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems.},

@article{Hubbard2010,
abstract = {Two modeling approaches are commonly used to estimate the associations between neighborhood characteristics and individual-level health outcomes in multilevel studies (subjects within neighborhoods). Random effects models (or mixed models) use maximum likelihood estimation. Population average models typically use a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach. These methods are used in place of basic regression approaches because the health of residents in the same neighborhood may be correlated, thus violating independence assumptions made by traditional regression procedures. This violation is particularly relevant to estimates of the variability of estimates. Though the literature appears to favor the mixed-model approach, little theoretical guidance has been offered to justify this choice. In this paper, we review the assumptions behind the estimates and inference provided by these 2 approaches. We propose a perspective that treats regression models for what they are in most circumstances: reasonable approximations of some true underlying relationship. We argue in general that mixed models involve unverifiable assumptions on the data-generating distribution, which lead to potentially misleading estimates and biased inference. We conclude that the estimation-equation approach of population average models provides a more useful approximation of the truth.},

This sampling procedure, called the parametric bootstrap cross-fitting method (PBCM; cf. Williams (J. R. Statist. Soc. B 32 (1970) 350; Biometrics 26 (1970) 23)), generates distributions of differences in goodness-of-fit expected under each of the competing models. In the data informed version of the PBCM, the generating models have specific parameter values obtained by fitting the experimental data under consideration. The data informed difference distributions can be compared to the observed difference in goodness-of-fit to allow a quantification of model adequacy. In the data uninformed version of the PBCM, the generating models have a relatively broad range of parameter values based on prior knowledge. Application of both the data informed and the data uninformed PBCM is illustrated with several examples.},

First, it provides a means of estimating the shape, scale, and location (shift) of RT distributions. Second, it is hierarchical and models between-subjects and within-subjects variability simultaneously. Third, inference with the model is Bayesian and provides a principled and efficient means of pooling information across disparate data from different individuals. Because the model efficiently pools information across individuals, it is particularly well suited for those common cases in which the researcher collects a limited number of observations from several participants. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the hierarchical Bayesian model provides more accurate estimates than several popular competitors do. We illustrate the model by providing an analysis of the symbolic distance effect in which participants can more quickly ascertain the relationship between nonadjacent digits than that between adjacent digits.},

There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justi?ed as Bayesian using a �savvy� prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non- Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based infer- ence should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging.},

The methodology can mislead researchers in several ways, including: (a) a lack of power can result in an erroneous rejection of the theory; (b) the focus on directionality (ordinal tests) rather than more precise quantitative predictions limits the information gained; and (c) the misuse of probability values to indicate effect size. An alternative approach is proposed which involves employing the theory to generate explicit effect size predictions that are compared to the effect size estimates and related confidence intervals to test the theoretical predictions. This procedure is illustrated employing the Transtheoretical Model. Data from a sample (N = 3,967) of smokers from a large New England HMO system were used to test the model. There were a total of 15 predictions evaluated, each involving the relation between Stage of Change and one of the other 15 Transtheoretical Model variables. For each variable, omega-squared and the related confidence interval were calculated and compared to the predicted effect sizes. Eleven of the 15 predictions were confirmed, providing support for the theoretical model. Quantitative predictions represent a much more direct, informative, and strong test of a theory than the traditional test of significance.},

abstract = {Linear mixed models (LMMs) provide a still underused methodological perspective on combining experimental and individual-differences research. Here we illustrate this approach with two-rectangle cueing in visual attention (Egly et al., 1994). We replicated previous experimental cue-validity effects relating to a spatial shift of attention within an object (spatial effect), to attention switch between objects (object effect), and to the attraction of attention toward the display centroid (attraction effect), also taking into account the design-inherent imbalance of valid and other trials. We simultaneously estimated variance/covariance components of subject-related random effects for these spatial, object, and attraction effects in addition to their mean reaction times (RTs). The spatial effect showed a strong positive correlation with mean RT and a strong negative correlation with the attraction effect. The analysis of individual differences suggests that slow subjects engage attention more strongly at the cued location than fast subjects. We compare this joint LMM analysis of experimental effects and associated subject-related variances and correlations with two frequently used alternative statistical procedures.},

They then summarize the relevant techniques, and draw on examples - many of them from the authors' own work - and aim to convey a sense of the potential, but also the strengths and weaknesses, of those techniques. This book is meant for graduate students in statistics, economics, policy analysis, and social sciences, especially, but certainly not exclusively, those interested in the challenges of economic development in the Third World. Additionally, the book will be useful to academics and practitioners who work closely with survey data. This is a book that can serve as a reference work, to be taken down from the shelf and perused from time to time.},

@article{Pocock2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most clinical trial publications include figures, but there is little guidance on what results should be displayed as figures and how. PURPOSE: To evaluate the current use of figures in Trial reports, and to make constructive suggestions for future practice. METHODS: We surveyed all 77 reports of randomised controlled trials in five general medical journals during November 2006 to January 2007. The numbers and types of figures were determined, and then each Figure was assessed for its style, content, clarity and suitability. As a consequence, guidelines are developed for presenting figures, both in general and for each specific common type of Figure. RESULTS: Most trial reports contained one to three figures, mean 2.3 per article. The four main types were flow diagram, Kaplan Meier plot, Forest plot (for subgroup analyses) and repeated measures over time: these accounted for 92{\%} of all figures published. For each type of figure there is a considerable diversity of practice in both style and content which we illustrate with selected examples of both good and bad practice. Some pointers on what to do, and what to avoid, are derived from our critical evaluation of these articles' use of figures. CONCLUSION: There is considerable scope for authors to improve their use of figures in clinical trial reports, as regards which figures to choose, their style of presentation and labelling, and their specific content. Particular improvements are needed for the four main types of figures commonly used.},

@article{Spellman2001,
abstract = {Research on semantic memory has often tacitly treated semantic relations as simple conduits for spreading activation between associated object concepts, rather than as integral components of semantic organization. Yet conceptual relations, and the role bindings they impose on the objects they relate, are central to such cognitive tasks as discourse comprehension, inference, problem solving, and analogical reasoning. The present study addresses the question of whether semantic relations and their bindings can influence access to semantic memory. The experiments investigated whether, and under what conditions, presenting a prime pair of words linked by 1 of 10 common semantic relations would facilitate processing of a target pair of words linked by the same relation. No effect was observed when participants merely read the prime; however, relational priming was observed under instructions to note and use the semantic relations. Participants were faster at making a lexical decision or naming a word on a related pair of target words when that pair was primed with an analogously related pair of words than when the prime pair consisted of either two unrelated words or two words linked by some other relation. This evidence of analogical priming suggests that under an appropriate strategic set, lexical decisions and naming latencies can be influenced by a process akin to analogical mapping.},

abstract = {Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) continue to grow in popularity due to their ability to directly acknowledge multiple levels of dependency and model different data types. For small sample sizes especially, likelihood-based inference can be unreliable with variance components being particularly difficult to estimate. A Bayesian approach is appealing but has been hampered by the lack of a fast implementation, and the difficulty in specifying prior distributions with variance components again being particularly problematic. Here, we briefly review previous approaches to computation in Bayesian implementations of GLMMs and illustrate in detail, the use of integrated nested Laplace approximations in this context. We consider a number of examples, carefully specifying prior distributions on meaningful quantities in each case. The examples cover a wide range of data types including those requiring smoothing over time and a relatively complicated spline model for which we examine our prior specification in terms of the implied degrees of freedom. We conclude that Bayesian inference is now practically feasible for GLMMs and provides an attractive alternative to likelihood-based approaches such as penalized quasi-likelihood. As with likelihood-based approaches, great care is required in the analysis of clustered binary data since approximation strategies may be less accurate for such data.},

abstract = {Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

However, this problem can easily be solved by including the average of each individual-level predictors in the group-level regression.

abstract = {This paper considers Bayesian counterparts of the classical tests for goodness of fit and their use in judging the fit of a single Bayesian model to the observed data. We focus on posterior predictive assessment, in a framework that also includes conditioning on auxiliary statistics. The Bayesian formulation facilitates the construction and calculation of a meaningful reference distribution not only for any (classical) statistic, but also for any parameter-dependent ``statistic" or discrepancy. The latter allows us to propose the realized discrepancy assessment of model fitness, which directly measures the true discrepancy between data and the posited model, for any aspect of the model which we want to explore. The computation required for the realized discrepancy assessment is a straightforward byproduct of the posterior simulation used for the original Bayesian analysis. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nWe illustrate with three applied examples. The first example, which serves mainly to motivate the work, illustrates the difficulty of classical tests in assessing the fitness of a Poisson model to a positron emission tomography image that is constrained to be nonnegative. The second and third examples illustrate the details of the posterior predictive approach in two problems: estimation in a model with inequality constraints on the parameters, and estimation in a mixture model. In all three examples, standard test statistics (either a X 2 or a likelihood ratio) are not pivotal: the difficulty is not just how to compute the reference distribution for the test, but that in the classical framework no such distribution exists, independent of the unknown model parameters.},

However, power analysis is flawed in that a narrow emphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study design. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can often be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.},

It has been reported that the tilt aftereffect is not direction specific. That is, the magnitude of the misperception was not affected by whether the adaptation and test stimuli were moving in the same or the opposite directions. However, when we required subjects to fixate on a stationary spot during adaptation to a moving grating, the tilt aftereffect was strongest when both stimuli moved in the same direction. More- over. the tilt aftereffect was not direction specific without such fixation. These results are consistent with the distribution shift model in which the perceived orientation reflects the distribution of orientation selective units, some of which are also direction selective.},

@misc{Gelman1995,
abstract = {This article presents the authors' comments on the article Bayesian Model Selection in Social Research by Adrian E. Raftery in the January 1995 issue. Raftery's paper addresses two important problems in the statistical analysis of social science data: (1) choosing an appropriate model when so much data are available that standard P-values reject all parsimonious models; and (2) making estimates and predictions when there are not enough data available to fit the desired model using standard techniques. For both problems, we agree with Raftery that classical frequentist methods fail and that Raftery's suggested methods based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC) can point in better directions. Nevertheless, we disagree with his solutions because, in principle, they are still directed off-target and only by serendipity manage to hit the target in special circumstances. Our primary criticisms of Raftery's proposals are that (1) he promises the impossible: the selection of a model that is adequate for specific purposes without consideration of those purposes; and (2) he uses the same limited tool for model averaging as for model selection, thereby depriving himself of the benefits of the broad range of available Bayesian procedures.},

abstract = {The shape of a reaction time (RT) distribution can be described by a 3-parameter model consisting of the convolution of the normal and exponential distributions, the ex-Gaussian. Analyses based on mean RT do not take the distribution's shape into account and, for that reason, may obscure aspects of performance. To illustrate the point, the ex-Gaussian model was applied to data obtained from a Stroop task. Mean RT revealed strong interference but no facilitation, whereas the analysis based on the ex-Gaussian model showed both interference and facilitation. In short, analyses that do not take the shape of RT distributions into account can mislead and, therefore, should be avoided.},

abstract = {Although it is generally accepted that the spread of a response time (RT) distribution increases with the mean, the precise nature of this relation remains relatively unexplored. The authors show that in several descriptive RT distributions, the standard deviation increases linearly with the mean. Results from a wide range of tasks from different experimental paradigms support a linear relation between RT mean and RT standard deviation. Both R. Ratcliff's (1978) diffusion model and G. D. Logan's (1988) instance theory of automatization provide explanations for this linear relation. The authors identify and discuss 3 specific boundary conditions for the linear law to hold. The law constrains RT models and supports the use of the coefficient of variation to (a) compare variability while controlling for differences in baseline speed of processing and (b) assess whether changes in performance with practice are due to quantitative speedup or qualitative reorganization.},

abstract = {When respondents answer paper-and-pencil (PP) questionnaires, they sometimes modify their responses to correspond to previously answered items. As a result, this response bias might artificially inflate the reliability of PP questionnaires. We compared the internal consistency of PP questionnaires to computerized questionnaires that presented a different number of items on a computer screen simultaneously. Study 1 showed that a PP questionnaire's internal consistency was higher than that of the same questionnaire presented on a computer screen with one, two or four questions per screen. Study 2 replicated these findings to show that internal consistency was also relatively high when all questions were shown on one screen. This suggests that the differences found in Study 1 were not due to the difference in presentation medium. Thus, this paper suggests that reliability measures of PP questionnaires might be inflated because of a response bias resulting from participants cross-checking their answers against ones given to previous questions.},

We review variables known to influence aesthetic judgments, such as figural goodness, figure-ground contrast, stimulus repetition, symmetry, and prototypicality, and trace their effects to changes in processing fluency. Other variables that influence processing fluency, like visual or semantic priming, similarly increase judgments of aesthetic pleasure. Our proposal provides an integrative framework for the study of aesthetic pleasure and sheds light on the interplay between early preferences versus cultural influences on taste, preferences for both prototypical and abstracted forms, and the relation between beauty and truth. In contrast to theories that trace aesthetic pleasure to objective stimulus features per se, we propose that beauty is grounded in the processing experiences of the perceiver, which are in part a function of stimulus properties.},

The use of definition variables (i.e., observed variables used to fix model parameters to individual specific data values) is extended to the case of ML-SEMs for clustered data with random slopes. Empirical examples of multilevel CFA and ML-SEM with random slopes are provided along with scripts for fitting such models in SAS Proc Mixed, Mplus, and Mx. Methodological issues regarding estimation of complex ML-SEMs and the evaluation of model fit are discussed. Further potential applications of ML-SEMs are explored.},

@article{Ho2017a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Using a hypothetical graph, Masahiro Mori proposed in 1970 the relation between the human likeness of robots and other anthropomorphic characters and an observer's affective or emotional appraisal of them. The relation is positive apart from a U-shaped region known as the uncanny valley. To measure the relation, we previously developed and validated indices for the perceptual-cognitive dimension humanness and three affective dimensions: interpersonal warmth, attractiveness, and eeriness. Nevertheless, the design of these indices was not informed by how the untrained observer perceives anthropomorphic characters categorically. As a result, scatter plots of humanness vs. eeriness show the stimuli cluster tightly into categories widely separated from each other. The present study applies a card sorting task, laddering interview, and adjective evaluation (N= 30) to revise the humanness, attractiveness, and eeriness indices and validate them via a representative survey (N= 1311). The revised eeriness index maintains its orthogonality to humanness (r=. 04 , p=. 285), but the stimuli show much greater spread, reflecting the breadth of their range in human likeness and eeriness. The revised indices enable empirical relations among characters to be plotted similarly to Mori's graph of the uncanny valley. Accurate measurement with these indices can be used to enhance the design of androids and 3D computer animated characters.},

abstract = {In the field of cognitive psychology, the p-value hypothesis test has established a stranglehold on statistical reporting. This is unfortunate, as the p-value provides at best a rough estimate of the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an experimental effect. An alternative and arguably more appropriate measure of evidence is conveyed by a Bayesian hypothesis test, which prefers the model with the highest average likelihood. One of the main problems with this Bayesian hypothesis test, however, is that it often requires relatively sophisticated numerical methods for its computation. Here we draw attention to the Savage-Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method's validity, generality, and flexibility. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We studied the validity of this cognitive interpretation by relating the parameters of the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald distributions to those of the Ratcliff diffusion model, a successful model whose parameters have well-established cognitive interpretations. In a simulation study, we fitted the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald distributions to data generated from the diffusion model by systematically varying its parameters across a wide range of plausible values. In an empirical study, the two descriptive distributions were fitted to published data that featured manipulations of task difficulty, response caution, and a priori bias. The results clearly demonstrate that the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald parameters do not correspond uniquely to parameters of the diffusion model. We conclude that researchers should resist the temptation to interpret changes in the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald parameters in terms of cognitive processes.
