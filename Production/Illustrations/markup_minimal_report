# Results
    
In the study we examined

1. whether on average users can rent a car in 99 seconds
2. and if we can say that with sufficient certainty
    
## Data exploration


```{r}
summary(D)
```

```{r}
summary(D)
```

All variables show good variation.
    
## Regression

```{r}
M_1 <- stan_lm(ToT ~ 1, data = D)
```

```{r}
coef(M_1) %>% knitr::kable()
```


Our main observations are:

+ the 99 seconds claim is not supported
+ time-on-task measures are not normally distributed
