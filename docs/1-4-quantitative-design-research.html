<p>A <em>design</em> is the structure of an artifact or process that people make for a purpose. This definition appears extremely broad as it covers everything, tea kettles, software, cockpits, training programs and complex human-machine systems. In fact, this definition is even redundant in two points: first, artifacts are usually made for a purpose and some call them just “tools”. Second, who else than people have purposes? Well, many wild animals reportedly create artificial structures for purposes such as shelter, mating and hunting. And when I have chosen such a broad definition for design, it is that I have absolutely no objections against using this book to compare the stability of birds nestings, for example. (In such a case, everyone please, read “design” as “part of the extended phenotype” and “purpose” as “emerged by natural selection”.</p>
<p>This book may apply to everything anyone likes to call a design; but only so for a specific set of research questions that hinge on the word “purpose”. We all have purposes and much of the time it is quite a job to get there. Getting-there typically requires resources and often enough we find ourselves right there only to some extent. So, the two basic questions in <em>quantitative design research</em> are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>to what amount is a purpose fulfilled?</li>
<li>how easy is it to get there?</li>
</ol>
<p>To the apt reader this may sound as i would next reduce all quantitative design research to the concept of usability and in a way i will be doing just that below (even discarding some subconcepts). The point here is that statistician actually don’t care much about definitions from a domain, but think about research problems in a more abstract manner. Here is a number of things, a statistician would inquire:</p>
<ul>
<li>On what a scale is the measurement of purpose fulfillment?</li>
<li>What is the expected precision of measures? Is a lot of noise to be expected?</li>
<li>How many observations are available?</li>
<li>Is the research concerned with how purpose fulfillment compares under various conditions?</li>
<li>How are observations grouped?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this book, quantitative design research is rather defined by a set of typical research problems, which includes the structure of the research question, as well as the empirical circumstances. In the following I will break this down one by one, and will also point out why the statistical framework of this book <em>Bayesian regression models</em> will do the job.</p>
<div id="introduce-magnitude-as-this-is-used-when-explaining-uncertainty." class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">1.4.0.4.1</span> Introduce magnitude, as this is used when explaining uncertainty.</h5>
<p>One obvious element is <em>quantification</em>, but that carries some ambiguity, as we can speak of measures or research questions. In much research, quantification happens during the process of measuring. Recording reaction times or counting errors certainly is quantitative. But, what matters is to really ask <em>quantitative research questions</em> and try to answer them. In the real world, decisions are (or should be) based on benefits and rational allocation of resources. Changing the background color of a website might just be a switch (and can have undesired effects as users hate change), but restructuring an intranet site can cost a million. In industrial design research, there usually is someone who wants to know whether this or that redesign is worth it, and that requires to ask research questions like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>By how much does reaction ability degrade with age and it is safe that people beyond 80 still drive?</li>
<li>Does design B reduce the required number of steps by a third, at least?</li>
<li>What proportion of users prefers red over yellow? All websites better go red?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, in much existing research, precise quantification is frequently lost along the way and conclusions read more like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Older people have longer reaction times in traffic situations (<span class="math inline">\(p \leq .05\)</span>).</li>
<li>People find information more easily with design A, compared to B (<span class="math inline">\(p \leq .05\)</span>).</li>
<li>Chinese people on average prefer red color schemes over yellow (<span class="math inline">\(p \leq .001\)</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>There simply is no numbers in these statements (except for the notorious p-values, which I will briefly discuss in chapter @ref(bayesian_statistics)).</p>
<p>Regression models are just right for measures and they are terrific at drawing quantitative conclusions. Every regression model features a so called <em>outcome</em>, which must be a measure (rather than a category). At the same time, regression models can deal with a broad class of measures and their peculiarities.</p>
<p>Modern designs tend to be very complex and so are research questions, potentially. The options for designing just your personal homepage are myriad and there is considerable uncertainty about which options, or rather which configuration works best. Consider every option, say font type, font size, color, background color, position of menu, a potential impact factor on how pleasant the page is to read. Perhaps, someone should once and for all figure out the optimal configuration. It is recommended in such a case, that as many as possible impact factors are represented in a single study and evaluated by a single comprehensive statistical model. The primary reason for this recommendation is given in chapter @ref(interaction_effects): impact factors have the nasty tendency to not act out independent of each other. Regression models handle such complexity with grace. There is theoretically no limit for the number of impact factors or <em>predicors</em> and interaction effects.</p>
<p>The central peculiarity in all behavioural research is that measures are extremely <em>noisy</em>. In the next chapter, the concept of measurement errors will be elaborated upon, but for now it suffices to understand that all measures approximate the measured property, only and that leaves room for <em>uncertainty</em>. In a simple experiment where participants respond to a signal and time is recorded, the first three trials will more likely have values that are widely scattered, like 900ms, 1080ms, 1110ms. Imagine this were an ability test in a training for, say, astronauts. To be admissioned to the space program the applicant needs a score of less than 1000ms. Would you dare to decide on the career of a young person based on these three observations? Hardly so.</p>
<p>On the other side, consider measuring a persons waste length for the purpose of tayloring a suit. By using a meter the taylor measures 990mm, and would be perfectly fine with that. Why did the taylor not take a second and a third measure? Well, experience tells that meters are pretty precise measures and waste length shows relatively little variation (under constant habits). Say the two measures were 995mm and 989mm. Such small deviations have practically no influence on cutting the linen.</p>

<p>Vast fluctuations of measures are common in design research, simply for the fact that human behaviour is involved. Every magnitude we derive from a study is uncertain to some degree. Uncertainty makes that at any moment, we can rely on a quantitative result only to some extent, which influences how we take risks. Statistics is called inferential, when every derived magnitude comes with a degree of certainty attached. Section @ref(decision_making) gives some reasoning and examples, how to operate rationally under uncertainty, and drives at right into the arms of Bayesian statistics.</p>
<p>In an admission test for astronaut training, a decision is raised on very few individuals. Down on earth, everyday designs affect many people at once. Consider your personal homepage. If you decide, for aesthetic reasons, to shrink the font size, I promise you, that you just start loosing all visitors from the e-senior generation. Or, if your content is really good, they start using looking glasses on their o-pads. As a researcher, you can approach this in two ways: do a user study to compare the new design to the current design, or be the one who finds out, once and for all, what the optimal trade-off is between readability and aesthetic pleasure. Your method of choice would be an experiment.</p>
<p>When you have no greater goal in mind than proving your design is of quality, <em>user studies</em> are effective and quick. In the easiest case, you want to put your design against a fixed benchmark. For example, in the design of automotives, media devices in the cockpit may not distract the driver for more than 1.5 seconds at times [REF]. To prove that, you will have to plug some advanced eye tracking gear into a prototype car and send people on the test drive. But once the precise data is in, things get really simple. The saccade measures directly represent what you were out for: the length of episodes of visual attention on the media display. You can take the average value. IN web design, it is common to compare two or more designs in order to make the best choice. An e-commerce company can put a potential future design on the test drive, delivering it to a customer sample. Performance is measured as hard currency, which is as close to the purpose as it can get.</p>
<p>A user studies solves the momentary problem of comparing a local design to a benchmark (which can be another design). In the long run, design configurations are too manyfold to be compared in a one-by-one manner. It is inevitable that we try to trace some general patterns and apply our knowledge to a whole class of designs at once. Our research design just got one step more complex. Instead of just checking whether a smaller font size creates problems on a single website, the reseacher reaches out to comparing the combined effect of aging and font size on reading time, in general. This is what I call a <em>design experiment</em>.</p>
<p>Design experiments allow for much broader conclusions, if done right, and there are a some issues:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The design features under scrunity must be under control of the researcher. It does not suffice to collect some websites with varying font sizes, but every website needs to undergo the test at various font sizes.</li>
<li>The design feature must undergo a full range of manipulations. You will not find the laws of readability by just comparing 10pt versus 12pt.</li>
<li>Design features usually do not stand on their own. Readability is influenced by other factors, such as contrast and comprehensibility. Deriving a model from just one design will only generalize to this one design. Hence, the researcher must run the experiment on a sample of designs, with one of two strategies (or a mix of both): the <em>randomization strategy</em> takes a representative sample of designs, hoping that other impact factors average out. As we will see in @ref(interaction_effects), this is a daring assumption. Therefore, the preferred way is <em>statistical control</em>, where potential impact factors are recorded and added as control variables to the regression model.</li>
