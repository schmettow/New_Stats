<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> The empirical design researcher</h3>
<p>If you are not a designer, chances are good that you are a design researcher very well. Are you doing studies with people and is your work about ways to achieve or improve products, services, trainings or business? Welcome to the not-so-special club of people I call design researchers.</p>
<p>Of course, I have no idea who you are, personally, but I figure you as one of the following personas:</p>
<p>You are an industrial design researcher, thirty-three years old, leading a small team in the center for research of a car maker. Your task is to evaluate emerging technologies, like augmented reality, car-to-car communication and smart light. Downstream research relies on your competent assessment of what is feasible. For example, you have just been asked to evaluate the following:
Blue light makes people wake up easier, could it also be used to let car drivers not fall asleep? Several engineers and one industrial engineering student are involved in putting a light color stimulator for a premium car of the brand and stuff two workstations in its back, hooked to the recording systems and driving performance and physiological measures. Yes, this is as expensive as it sounds, and this why you have skin in the game, when you do a study.</p>
<p>You are a young academic and just got a cum laude master’s degree in computer science. For your thesis you developed and implemented an animated avatar for a digital assistant. A professor from the social psychology department has read your thesis. He just got a funding for research on mass emergency communication using projected virtual characters. He fears that a young psychologist would not be up to the technical part of the project and found you. But, you ask yourself, am I up to the task of running experimental studies and do the statistics?</p>

<div id="the-experimentalist" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> The experimentalist</h3>
<p>If you are doing research with people, but the answers you seek are far from being applicable to anything in sight, don’t put this book away. Chances are good that you will be able to read through the ephemeral details of the cases I present and recognize your own research situations, for example that you are comparing two groups. As you can see in the table of contents, you don’t even have to read more than half the book to get there.</p>
<p>It may be true that strictly experimental data does not require more than group comparison. Still, I please you: also read the chapter on multilevel models. So much contemporary experimental research mistakens <em>average</em> for <em>universal</em>. It makes a difference to ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Are responses in the Stroop task responses delayed in the incongruent condition?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or to ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every person responds delayed in the incongruent condition?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your work is about revealing universal laws of behaviour, you have to search for the answer on an individual level. Technically, that means a rather simple multi-level model and a spaghetti plot will do the rest. But note that such a model is composed of many little participant-level models and all of them need their data. For multi-level models you need a within-subject design and repeated measures. On the second thought that makes full sense, as what really ask is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do all people shift into a slower mode in the incongruent condition?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not about groups of people, but mode transitions in individual brains. These transitions can only be observed by putting one-and-the-same person into all the conditions. If you fear that the order of modes makes a difference, why not put order under statistical control? Record what you cannot control and check the interaction effects. Maybe it is not so bad.</p>
<p>Just another candy for you: Response times! Have you been struggling with them forever, because they are not Normal distributed? Have you resorted to non-parametric tests so many times that what you say became “response times are non-parametric”? You shouldn’t say that. Furthermore, your non-parametric sacrifices can be history with Generalized Linear Models.</p>
<p>Then again, you may soon notice a disturbing lack of stars. Is this book like a very dark night? Consider the opposite possibility: most times when you don’t see the stars is at daylight. But let me hand you a torch with a chapter on model selection. The following paragraph may help you pushing your work through the review process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to confirm that the Stroop effect exists, we compared the predictive power of two models by information crieria. M_0 is an intercept-only model that denies the Stroop effect, M_1 allows for it. In order to evaluate universality of the Stroop effect, the models got participant-level random effects. As response times tend to have an offset and are left-skewed we chose exponential-Gaussian error distributions.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> The applied researcher</h3>
<p>Tongue-in-cheek, applied researchers take real problems to get their questions, but rarely solve them. Why not? It is legitimate, almost natural, to ask what causes the Uncanny Valley effect, for instance. You do a series of experimental study and also throw personality scales into the game. Maybe, the effect is not unversal. Why? Just that.</p>

<div id="how-to-read-this-book" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> How to read this book</h2>
<p>Chapter @ref(design_research) introduces a framework for quantitative design research. It carves out the basic elements of empirical design research, such as users, designs and performance and links them to typical research problems. Then the idea of design as decision making under uncertainty is developed at the example of two case studies.</p>
<p>Chapter @ref(bayesian_statistics) introduces the basic idea of Bayesian statistics, which boils down to three remarkably intuitive conjectures:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>uncertainty is the rule</li>
<li>you gain more certainty by observations</li>
<li>your present knowledge about the world is composed of what you learned from data and what you knew before.</li>
</ol>
<p>The chapter goes on with introducing basic terms of statistical thinking. Finally, an overview on common statistical distributions serve as a vehicle to make the reader familiar with data generazing processes. I am confident that this chapter serves newbies and classically trained researchers with all tools they need to understand Bayesian statistics. The more formally trained reader may want to take this as a bedtime reading.</p>
<p>Chapter @ref(getting_started_r) is a minimal introduction to this marvelous programming language. Readers with some programming experience can work through this in just one day and they will get everything they need to get started with the book. Readers with prior R experience may get a lot out of this chapter, too, as it introduces the <em>tidy</em> paradigm of R programming. Tidy R is best be thought of as a set standard libraries 2.0. New tidy packages are arriving at an accelerating pace in the R world, and coding tidy is usually much briefer, easier to read and less error prone. It has at least the same significance as turning from procedural programming to object orientation. While this chapter serves as a stepping stone, the reader will encounter countless code examples throughout the book, working through these examples is a</p>
<p>The second part of the book consists of three chapters that strictly built on each other. The first chapter @ref(linear_models) introduces basic elements of linear models, which are factors, covariates and interaction effects. A number of additional sections cover under-the-hood concepts, such as dummy variables or contrasts, as well as basic model criticism (residual analysis). Working through this chapter fully is essential as develops the jargon to a good deal.</p>
<p>However, for most readers, the first chapter is not sufficient to get to work, as it does not cover models for repeated measures. This is added extensively in chapter @ref(multilevel_models). It proceeds from simple repeated measures designs to complex designs, where human and multiple non-human populations encounter each other. After working through this chapter, the reader is prepared to design highly effective studies. As long as the patterns of randomness are not off by to much from the linear model assumptions, it also suffices to get to work, seriously.</p>
<p>The third chapter @ref(generalized_linear:models) opens up a plethora of possibilities to analyze all kinds of performance variables. Standard models are introduces to deal with counts, chances, temporal variables and rating scales. It is also meant as an eye opener for reseachers who routinely resorted to non-parametric procedures. After working through this chapter, I would consider anyone a sincere data analyst.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter @ref(nonlinear_models) re-iterates on the truth that in an endless universe everything is finite. We leave our fond of high-level regression engine alone and take a closer look at the nuts and bolts it is based upon. By the example of a logistic growth process and efefcts of training, the reader gains a preview on the almighty model specification language Stan.</p>
<p>The third part of the book is primarily dedicated to researchers who deal with complex and high-stake problems, routinely. Elememts of the statistical workflow are spread out in much detail, covering data manipulation, advanced graphics, simulation and model evaluation.</p>

<p>A <em>design</em> is the structure of an artifact or process that people make for a purpose. This definition appears extremely broad as it covers everything, tea kettles, software, cockpits, training programs and complex human-machine systems. In fact, this definition is even redundant in two points: first, artifacts are usually made for a purpose and some call them just “tools”. Second, who else than people have purposes? Well, many wild animals reportedly create artificial structures for purposes such as shelter, mating and hunting. And when I have chosen such a broad definition for design, it is that I have absolutely no objections against using this book to compare the stability of birds nestings, for example. (In such a case, everyone please, read “design” as “part of the extended phenotype” and “purpose” as “emerged by natural selection”.</p>
<p>This book may apply to everything anyone likes to call a design; but only so for a specific set of research questions that hinge on the word “purpose”. We all have purposes and much of the time it is quite a job to get there. Getting-there typically requires resources and often enough we find ourselves right there only to some extent. So, the two basic questions in <em>quantitative design research</em> are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>to what amount is a purpose fulfilled?</li>
<li>how easy is it to get there?</li>
</ol>
<p>To the apt reader this may sound as i would next reduce all quantitative design research to the concept of usability and in a way i will be doing just that below (even discarding some subconcepts). The point here is that statistician actually don’t care much about definitions from a domain, but think about research problems in a more abstract manner. Here is a number of things, a statistician would inquire:</p>
<ul>
<li>On what a scale is the measurement of purpose fulfillment?</li>
<li>What is the expected precision of measures? Is a lot of noise to be expected?</li>
<li>How many observations are available?</li>
<li>Is the research concerned with how purpose fulfillment compares under various conditions?</li>
<li>How are observations grouped?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this book, quantitative design research is rather defined by a set of typical research problems, which includes the structure of the research question, as well as the empirical circumstances. In the following I will break this down one by one, and will also point out why the statistical framework of this book <em>Bayesian regression models</em> will do the job.</p>
<div id="introduce-magnitude-as-this-is-used-when-explaining-uncertainty." class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">1.4.0.4.1</span> Introduce magnitude, as this is used when explaining uncertainty.</h5>
<p>One obvious element is <em>quantification</em>, but that carries some ambiguity, as we can speak of measures or research questions. In much research, quantification happens during the process of measuring. Recording reaction times or counting errors certainly is quantitative. But, what matters is to really ask <em>quantitative research questions</em> and try to answer them. In the real world, decisions are (or should be) based on benefits and rational allocation of resources. Changing the background color of a website might just be a switch (and can have undesired effects as users hate change), but restructuring an intranet site can cost a million. In industrial design research, there usually is someone who wants to know whether this or that redesign is worth it, and that requires to ask research questions like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>By how much does reaction ability degrade with age and it is safe that people beyond 80 still drive?</li>
<li>Does design B reduce the required number of steps by a third, at least?</li>
<li>What proportion of users prefers red over yellow? All websites better go red?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, in much existing research, precise quantification is frequently lost along the way and conclusions read more like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Older people have longer reaction times in traffic situations (<span class="math inline">\(p \leq .05\)</span>).</li>
<li>People find information more easily with design A, compared to B (<span class="math inline">\(p \leq .05\)</span>).</li>
<li>Chinese people on average prefer red color schemes over yellow (<span class="math inline">\(p \leq .001\)</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>There simply is no numbers in these statements (except for the notorious p-values, which I will briefly discuss in chapter @ref(bayesian_statistics)).</p>
<p>Regression models are just right for measures and they are terrific at drawing quantitative conclusions. Every regression model features a so called <em>outcome</em>, which must be a measure (rather than a category). At the same time, regression models can deal with a broad class of measures and their peculiarities.</p>
<p>Modern designs tend to be very complex and so are research questions, potentially. The options for designing just your personal homepage are myriad and there is considerable uncertainty about which options, or rather which configuration works best. Consider every option, say font type, font size, color, background color, position of menu, a potential impact factor on how pleasant the page is to read. Perhaps, someone should once and for all figure out the optimal configuration. It is recommended in such a case, that as many as possible impact factors are represented in a single study and evaluated by a single comprehensive statistical model. The primary reason for this recommendation is given in chapter @ref(interaction_effects): impact factors have the nasty tendency to not act out independent of each other. Regression models handle such complexity with grace. There is theoretically no limit for the number of impact factors or <em>predicors</em> and interaction effects.</p>
<p>The central peculiarity in all behavioural research is that measures are extremely <em>noisy</em>. In the next chapter, the concept of measurement errors will be elaborated upon, but for now it suffices to understand that all measures approximate the measured property, only and that leaves room for <em>uncertainty</em>. In a simple experiment where participants respond to a signal and time is recorded, the first three trials will more likely have values that are widely scattered, like 900ms, 1080ms, 1110ms. Imagine this were an ability test in a training for, say, astronauts. To be admissioned to the space program the applicant needs a score of less than 1000ms. Would you dare to decide on the career of a young person based on these three observations? Hardly so.</p>
<p>On the other side, consider measuring a persons waste length for the purpose of tayloring a suit. By using a meter the taylor measures 990mm, and would be perfectly fine with that. Why did the taylor not take a second and a third measure? Well, experience tells that meters are pretty precise measures and waste length shows relatively little variation (under constant habits). Say the two measures were 995mm and 989mm. Such small deviations have practically no influence on cutting the linen.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Vast fluctuations of measures are common in design research, simply for the fact that human behaviour is involved. Every magnitude we derive from a study is uncertain to some degree. Uncertainty makes that at any moment, we can rely on a quantitative result only to some extent, which influences how we take risks. Statistics is called inferential, when every derived magnitude comes with a degree of certainty attached. Section @ref(decision_making) gives some reasoning and examples, how to operate rationally under uncertainty, and drives at right into the arms of Bayesian statistics.</p>
<p>In an admission test for astronaut training, a decision is raised on very few individuals. Down on earth, everyday designs affect many people at once. Consider your personal homepage. If you decide, for aesthetic reasons, to shrink the font size, I promise you, that you just start loosing all visitors from the e-senior generation. Or, if your content is really good, they start using looking glasses on their o-pads. As a researcher, you can approach this in two ways: do a user study to compare the new design to the current design, or be the one who finds out, once and for all, what the optimal trade-off is between readability and aesthetic pleasure. Your method of choice would be an experiment.</p>
<p>When you have no greater goal in mind than proving your design is of quality, <em>user studies</em> are effective and quick. In the easiest case, you want to put your design against a fixed benchmark. For example, in the design of automotives, media devices in the cockpit may not distract the driver for more than 1.5 seconds at times [REF]. To prove that, you will have to plug some advanced eye tracking gear into a prototype car and send people on the test drive. But once the precise data is in, things get really simple. The saccade measures directly represent what you were out for: the length of episodes of visual attention on the media display. You can take the average value. IN web design, it is common to compare two or more designs in order to make the best choice. An e-commerce company can put a potential future design on the test drive, delivering it to a customer sample. Performance is measured as hard currency, which is as close to the purpose as it can get.</p>
<p>A user studies solves the momentary problem of comparing a local design to a benchmark (which can be another design). In the long run, design configurations are too manyfold to be compared in a one-by-one manner. It is inevitable that we try to trace some general patterns and apply our knowledge to a whole class of designs at once. Our research design just got one step more complex. Instead of just checking whether a smaller font size creates problems on a single website, the reseacher reaches out to comparing the combined effect of aging and font size on reading time, in general. This is what I call a <em>design experiment</em>.</p>
<p>Design experiments allow for much broader conclusions, if done right, and there are a some issues:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The design features under scrunity must be under control of the researcher. It does not suffice to collect some websites with varying font sizes, but every website needs to undergo the test at various font sizes.</li>
<li>The design feature must undergo a full range of manipulations. You will not find the laws of readability by just comparing 10pt versus 12pt.</li>
<li>Design features usually do not stand on their own. Readability is influenced by other factors, such as contrast and comprehensibility. Deriving a model from just one design will only generalize to this one design. Hence, the researcher must run the experiment on a sample of designs, with one of two strategies (or a mix of both): the <em>randomization strategy</em> takes a representative sample of designs, hoping that other impact factors average out. As we will see in @ref(interaction_effects), this is a daring assumption. Therefore, the preferred way is <em>statistical control</em>, where potential impact factors are recorded and added as control variables to the regression model.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.1</span> Interaction sequences</h3>
<p>Behavioural records not necessarily require one-way mirrors and the nights of video coding. Log files of web servers provide sequences of how users navigate a web site. Plugin software is available that records keystrokes and mouse actions on computers. The difficult part is the following: When observing 50 users while doing a non-trivial task, no two interaction sequences are exactly the same (if i had to bet on it). By itself, there is little value without further means of interpretation and this can go two ways up:</p>
<p>The diligent and skilled <em>qualitative</em> researchers are able to extract meaningful patterns from such sequences. For example, in usability tests, the following patterns are frequently observed and interpreted.</p>
<ul>
<li>a user jumping back to the main screen possibly went into a wrong direction</li>
<li>users randomly probing around either have no clue or no motivation</li>
<li>users in a longitudinal study who only interact at the begin and the end of the period, have no use for the system, really.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>quantitative</em> researcher will aim at deriving measures from the interaction sequence. Formally, <em>to measure</em> means assigning numbers to observed sequences, so that these can be brought into an <em>order</em>, at least. Obviously, we need some sort of transformation that gives us a single <em>performance score</em>. This we call here the <em>performance function</em> and we have many choices, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of all exploratory events</li>
<li>their relative frequency</li>
<li>their longest uninterrupted sequence</li>
<li>total time spent in exploration</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, you have to go a long way up the qualitative route, before you can derive useful measures. In [Schnittker, Schmettow &amp; Schraagen, 2016], we coded sequences from nurses using an infusion pump. Individual sequences were compared to a optimal reference path, the similar the better. But how to measure similarity? For eample, <em>Levensthein distance</em> counts the number of edits to transform one sequence into the other and we used it as the performance score: <em>deviation from optimal path</em>. Even more interpreting was another study we did on the active user paradox. We recorded interaction sequences of users doing some repetitive tasks with a graphics software. The sessions were taped and analysed using a behavioural coding scheme. First, events were classified on a low level (e.g. “reading the handbook”, “first time trying a function”) and later aggregated to broader classes (e.g. “exploratory behavior”). The number of events in a given time frame that were classified as such were finally taken as a measure, representing the exploratory tendencies.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.2</span> performance measures</h3>
<p>A good point to start with is the classic concept of “usability”, which the ISO 9142-11 defines by the following three high-level criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>effectiveness: can users accomplish their tasks?</li>
<li>efficiency: what resources have to be spend for a task, e.g. time.</li>
<li>satisfaction: how did the user like it?</li>
</ul>
<p>While these criteria originated in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, they can easily be adapted to compare everything that people do their work with. Even within the field, it has been adapted to hundreds of studies and a hundred ways are reported of assessing these criteria.</p>
<p><em>Effectiveness</em> is often measured by <em>completion rate (CR)</em>. A classic waterfall approach would be to consult the user requirements documents and identify the, let’s say eight, crucial tasks the system must support. User test might then show that most users fail at the two tasks, and a completion rate of 75% is recorded for the system. Completion rate is only a valid effectiveness measure with <em>distinct tasks</em>. Strictly, the set of tasks also had to be <em>complete</em>, covering the whole system. When completion rate is taken from in series of <em>repetitive tasks</em>, it depends on whether it is effectiveness or efficiency. It is effectiveness, when a failed operation is unrepairable, such as a traffic accident, data loss on a computer or medical errors. But, who cares for a single number between 0 and 1, when the user test provides such a wealth of information on <em>why</em> users failed? Effectiveness, in the sense of task completion, is primarily a qualitative issue and we shall rarely encounter it in this book.</p>
<p>A more subtle notion of effectiveness is the <em>quality of outcome</em>, and despite the very term, is a measure. Perhaps, it should better be called <em>task perfection</em>. Reconsider the AUP study, where participants had to modify a given graphic, e.g. change some colors and erase parts of it. Of course, some participants worked neatly, whereas others used broader strokes (literally). There certainly is a reasonable objective way to rank all results by quality.</p>
<p><em>Efficiency</em> is where it really gets quantitative as with efficiency, we ask about resources: time, attention, strain, distraction and Euros. Other than that, efficiency can be measured in a vast variety of ways: ToT, clicks, mental workload or time spent watching the traffic while driving.</p>
<p>Counting the <em>number of clicks</em> before someone has found the desired piece of informnation is a coarse, but easy to acquire and intuitive measure of efficiency, and so is <em>time-on-task (ToT)</em>, which is just the sum . Still, these It differs from ToT in that it only counts real action, not the time a participant read the manual or watched the sky. In the downside, this is a very limited definition of action. While errors are usually best analyzed qualitatively, <em>error rate</em> can be efficiency, too, when failures are non-critical, but can be repaired in some time, such as correcting a typing error.</p>
<p>ToT and other performance measures can be very noisy, and RT even more so. In order to arrive at sufficiently certain estimates, it is recommended to always plan for <em>repetition</em>. In [LMM] we will make heavy use of repeated measures on users, tasks and designs.</p>
<p>Above, I did not mean to say that design research always requires the sometimes painful recording of interaction sequences. The majority of studies jumps over them and proceed to performance measures, directly, by counting attempts or pressing stop watches.</p>
<p>In many situations, such <em>direct measures</em> are right spot-on: When controlling a car in dense city traffic, a few hundred milliseconds is what makes huge a difference and therefore <em>reaction time</em> is a valid performance measure. In experimental cognitive research reaction times are a dominant tool to reveal the structure of the mind. The Stroop tasks is a golden evergreen cognitive psychology and serves as an example. Participants are shown a words drawn in one of three ink colors and are asked to name the ink as quick as possible. The Stroop effect occurs: in the incongruent condition, participants respond much slower than in the congruent and neutral (a few hundred ms). There is ample sweet replication of this effect and an ecosystem of theories surround it.
In [Schmettow, Noordzij, Mundt] we employ the Stroop task to read the minds of participants. We showed them pictures with computers on them, followed by a printed word (e.g., “explore”) on which to perform the Stroop task. It was conceived that reaction time is increased when a participant experiences a strong association, like:</p>
<p>black tower PC + “explore” –&gt; “can someone hand me a screwdriver”</p>

incongr [YELLOW]: green
